        <div class="lyrics">W 1775
Wiggled one whisker and opened one eye
Half was dark earth and half was bright sky
He saw his mom stand and he thought he would try

But his legs couldn't hold him; they thrashed all about
But little by little he figured it out
And by the end of his first day
He would follow his mom and they'd run

The spring it gave way and the summer set sail
And he ran and he played and he chased his mom's tail
And the air was alive with the sting of cut grass
And that summer was like no one future or past

And then a truck pulled up painted green on the side
He jumped in the back and they went for a ride
South Of The Border on I-95
W1775

(Break)

Winter training began and it was a breeze
Left front, right rear, just as crisp as you please
He felt the bit in his mouth, he felt the girth clinched tight
He felt the left line attached, and then felt the right

And the cart was snapped on, and the driver said go
And he trotted
If you find yourself lost in this world as it rots
Watch the gravel kicked sideways as a two-year-old trots

If it isn't just glorious, lovely, and clean
Then my words can't describe what your eyes haven't seen
No my words can't describe what your eyes haven't seen

(Break)

When April came calling, he'd learned his job well
He'd handled his lessons, earned a toll of the bell
And eagerly North, the green truck, 95
Went W1775

Every week faster and faster they'd go
1775 and his foe
They paired him with a filly, they trained them together 
And their velocity soared along with the weather

And the next time the truck came it was just he and his girl
No road trip this time, just a short little whirl
To a racetrack where forty short years ago
Forty thousand a night would clamor to go

And when he was hooked and set out on the track
He'd never been there before but he felt he was back
At home with the stone dust, the grandstand, the rail 
As happy as when he'd followed mom's tail

And the starting car came and it opened its wings
Seven babies behind it, their tendons like springs
He put his nose on the gate like he'd always known how 
The only place here, and the only time now

And the gate sprung open, colors flew all around
Horses charged from both sides but he held his ground
And 1775 saw it all
And soon he was racing each week until fall

He didn't win all his races but still he won plenty
Of ninety-six tries he won almost twenty
He wasn't a champ but he paid his way
But once he turned eight, he lost a step then another

And one race was worse and was worse than the other
One day a man came to talk to the trainer
He said "do you have anything here who can't beat a claimer"?

Hands in his pockets, averting his eyes
He said yes, W1775
But find him a good horse or at least a good job
He's a hard-working horse and he can't be robbed

Of the rest of his life that he earned while racing
The main said I'll see what I can do with the placing
So under the tunnel, New Jersey, New York,
Where his great great grandsire worked through the great war

And life was so different, but no one else cared
Just a carriage horse now, not excited, not scared
Now the mornings were different, but he was the same,
Though when he was a racehorse he'd once had a name

Now he was just a number tattooed on his hide
W1775
And nobody raced, their carts heavy and slow,
But he learned every street, red for stop green for go

And the cars had no wings but there were people to meet
Kids' feet not to step on, water troughs in the heat
He'd raced for six years, pulled a cariage for nine
And through those fifteen, his coat lost its shine

And the muscles so tense and so taut when he raced
Were tired and spent and lost and displaced
They called his old owner; could she give him a home
She said "we've always got a place for one of our own"

And the van shook and rattled, and the door was pulled down
Inviting him down to fresh grass and fresh ground
Inviting him down to  fresh grass and fresh ground
W1775

Wiggled one whisker and closed one eye
All was dark earth, gone the bright sky
But he felt a deep rest, why fight it, why try
He spent his life doing only things he'd been told

And he'd never decided on how to grow old
But he was never more than a length from fully alive
