## SHORT BIO (100 words)

Peter Kleinhans is a New York-based singer-songwriter whose music weaves narrative threads through folk, pop, and rock in the tradition of Harry Chapin. After three decades as a harness racing professional—calling races at tracks across America and part-owning three racetracks—Peter brings a storyteller's perspective to songs that explore the human experience from all angles. His warm, distinctive vocals and thoughtful lyrics create a compassionate lens on modern life. With four albums and regular performances at The Bitter End and City Winery, Peter crafts music that seeks understanding and connection in an increasingly fragmented world.

## LONG BIO (300 words)

Peter Kleinhans represents a rare convergence of worlds: the racetrack and the recording studio, the analytical mind and the artist's soul.

For thirty years, Peter lived and breathed harness racing. He called races from behind the microphone at The Meadows, Hoosier Park, The Meadowlands, Freehold, and Oak Grove. He trained horses, drove them in amateur races, and became part owner of three racetracks alongside Jeff Gural. His greatest champion was Enough Talk, a legitimate free-for-all trotter who earned nearly $2 million and took Peter to Sweden for the prestigious Elitloppet at Solvalla.

But Peter's path wound through more than the oval. He studied creative writing and philosophy at Carnegie Mellon, earned a law degree from the University of Michigan, and passed the New York bar at NYU. Unable to find an area of law compelling enough for full-time practice, he brought his analytical mind to family real estate in Manhattan—a business built into an empire by his grandmother, whom he describes as "one of the greatest real estate entrepreneurs in the history of the City."

Through it all, music called. In 2018, Peter released his debut album "Something's Not Right" to critical acclaim. LA Music Critic hailed it "one of the best debut albums we have reviewed," while critics compared his sound to Dave Matthews and placed him in the protest tradition of Neil Young and Phil Ochs.

Peter's music doesn't just observe the world—it bears witness. He writes stories from all perspectives, about people from all walks of life, seeking to understand the human experience and build a more compassionate world. His songs capture the unease, hope, and complexity of modern life with wit, warmth, and wisdom.

He performs regularly at The Bitter End in Greenwich Village and City Winery, continuing to juggle his many pursuits: father, songwriter, singer, guitar player, racetrack owner, lawyer, race caller, harness breeder, driver, trainer, writer, and investor. A true renaissance man whose music creates bridges between people.
