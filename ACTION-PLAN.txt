## WHAT I NEED FROM YOU NOW:

1. **Peter's Spotify artist page URL**
2. **Press kit** - Do you have a PDF? Or should button go to Press page?
3. **Press links** - List of articles/reviews to feature on press.html
4. **Confirm**: Should I update ALL navigation to include separate Press link?

Once I have these, I can finish Phase 1 and you'll have a complete, working site ready to show Peter!
